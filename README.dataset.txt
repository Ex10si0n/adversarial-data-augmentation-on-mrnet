# Use Cases

Build a flower classifier model! Consider deploying that to a mobile app for outdoor enthusiasts or florist hobbyists.

# Using this Dataset

Use the `fork` button to copy this dataset to your own Roboflow account and export it with new preprocessing settings (perhaps resized for your model's desired format or converted to grayscale), or additional augmentations to make your model generalize better. This particular dataset would be very well suited for Roboflow's new advanced [Bounding Box Only Augmentations](https://blog.roboflow.ai/introducing-bounding-box-level-augmentations/).
